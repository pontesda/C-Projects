# C++ Coding Projects


### Thank you for visiting my portfolio! 

I am currently studying Computer Science at Fairleigh Dickinson University with a passion for software development.

My goal is to further expand software development and leadership skills in a professional environment that promotes teamwork through rigorous challenges.

Below you will find current projects I have created the C++ Language. 

The purpose of this page is to showcase my skills while collaborating with other developers around the world.

Cheers!
