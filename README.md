Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I am currently studying Computer Science at Fairleigh Dickinson University with a passion for software development. I want to have a helping hand in creating software to help make the world a better place. Below you will find current projects I have created in an effort to increase my development skills in the C++ Language. 

The purpose of this site is to showcase my skills but also to inspire others to create a similiar portfolio for their personal advancement. 

Cheers!
