# C++ Coding Projects
Coding projects I created in my C++ programming course.
Below you will find descriptions of the problems I was asked to solved.

SOFTWARE SALES
A software company sells a package that retails for $99. Quantity discounts are given according to the following table.
Quantity	Discount
10 – 19 	20%
20 – 49 	30%
50 – 99 	40%
100 or more	50%

Write a program that asks for the number of units sold and computes the total cost of the purchase.

GEOMETRY CALCULATOR

Write a program with a switch statement that displays the following menu:
Geometry Calculator
1.	Calculate the Area of a Circle
2.	Calculate the Area of a Rectangle
3.	Calculate the Area of a Triangle
4.	Quit
If the user enters ‘1’, the program should ask for the radius of the circle and then display its area.  Use 3.14159 for PI.  
If the user enters ‘2’, the program should ask for the length and the width of the rectangle and then display its area. 
 If the user enters ‘3’, the program should ask for the length of the triangle’s base and its height and display the area.  
Entering ‘4’, should quit the application.  
Use input validation to make sure the user selects a valid menu option and does not input negative numbers for the measurements.

SPECTRAL ANALYSIS

If a scientist knows the wavelength of an electromagnetic wave, he or she can determine what type of radiation it is. 
Write a program that asks for the wavelength of an electromagnetic wave in meters and then displays 
what that wave is according to the chart.  

> 1 x 10-2	1 x 10-2	1 x 10-3	7 x 10-7	4 x 10-7	1 x 10-8	1 x 10-11	0
Radio Waves	Microwaves	Infrared	Visible Light	Ultraviolet	X Rays	Gamma Rays
